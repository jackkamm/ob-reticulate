;;; Commentary:

;; Org-Babel support for the R package reticulate, which enables use
;; of Python within R.

;;; Code:

(require 'ob-python)

  "Toggle to enable ob-reticulate-mode.

When enabled, the :session header argument of ob-python blocks
may be an R session.  Note the R session should have the reticulate
library loaded before executing ob-python blocks with it.

Also, note that ob-reticulate blocks use header arguments for
`ob-R' instead of `ob-python'.  For example, the :colnames and
:rownames headers, which are available in ob-R but not ob-python,
can be used with Python blocks executed by ob-reticulate."
